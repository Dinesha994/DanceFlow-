### Project description: 
DanceFlow is a web application where users will be able to create, schedule, and track the progress of their dance sessions. Users can choose their preferred dance moves from a database, customize their sequences, and schedule their sessions in a calendar. This also allows users to track their progress, set new goals, and interact with the community of dancers. 

By providing a structured platform, DanceFlow aims to help the dancers stay organized and develop their dancing skills. Many other dancers have problems in staying consistent and tracking their progress, so this DanceFlow web application makes it easier to organize and finish thier sessions.
